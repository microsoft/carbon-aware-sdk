# Getting Started

This SDK has several entry points:

- You can run the application using the [CLI](./src/CarbonAware.CLI).

- You can build a container containing the [WebAPI](./src/CarbonAware.WebApi) and connect via REST requests.

- (Future) You can install the Nuget package and make requests directly.

Each of these has configuration requirements which are detailed below.

## Data Sources

We intend to support multiple data sources for carbon data.  At this time, only a JSON file and [WattTime](https://www.watttime.org/) are supported.  To use WattTime data, you'll need to acquire a license from them and set the appropriate configuration information.

## Configuration

This project uses standard [Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration) mechanisms.

The WebAPI project uses standard configuration sources provided by [ASPNetCore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/).  Please review this link to understand how configuration is loaded and the priority of that configuration.

Please note that configuration is heirarchical.  The last configuration source loaded that contains a configuration value will be the value that's used.  This means that if the same configuration value is found in both appsettings.json and as an environment variable, the value from the environment variable will be the value that's applied.

When adding values via environment variables, we recommend that you use the double underscore form, rather than the colon form.  Colons won't work in non-windows environment.  For example:

```bash
  CarbonAwareVars__CarbonIntensityDataSource="WattTime"
```

Note that double underscores are used to represent dotted notation or child elements that you see in the JSON below.  For example, to set proxy information using environment variables, you'd do this:

```bash
  CarbonAwareVars__Proxy__UseProxy
```

### CarbonAwareSDK Specific Configuration

#### CarbonAwareVars

Used to configure specific values that affect how the application gets data and the routes exposed.  The configuration looks like this:

```json
{
    "carbonAwareVars": {
        "carbonIntensityDataSource": "",
        "webApiRoutePrefix": "",
        "proxy": {
            "useProxy": false,
            "url": "",
            "username": "",
            "password": ""
        }
    }
}
```

##### carbonIntensityDataSource

Must be one of the following: `None, JSON, WattTime`.  

If set to `WattTime`, WattTime configuration must also be supplied.

`None` is the default, and if this value is supplied, an exception will be thrown at startup.

`JSON` will result in the data being loaded from a [json file](./src/CarbonAware.DataSources.Json/test-data-azure-emissions.json) compiled into the project.  You should not use these values in production, since they are static and don't represent carbon intensity accurately.

##### webApiRoutePrefix

Used to add a prefix to all routes in the WebApi project.  Must start with a `/`.  Invalid paths will cause an exception to be thrown at startup.

By default, all controllers are off of the root path.  For example:

```bash
http://localhost/sci-scores
```

If this prefix is set, it will allow calls to controllers using the prefix, which can be helpful for cross cluster calls, or when proxies strip out information from headers.  For example, if this value is set to:

```bash
/mydepartment/myapp
```

Then calls can be made that look like this:

```bash
http://localhost/mydepartment/myapp/sci-scores
```

Note that the controllers still respond off of the root path.

##### proxy

This value is used to set proxy information in situations where internet egress requires a proxy.  For proxy values to be used `useProxy` must be set to `true`.  Other values should be set as needed for your environment.

### WattTime Configuration

If using the WattTime datasource, WattTime configuration is required.

```json
{
    "wattTimeClient":{
        "username": "",
        "password": "",
        "baseUrl": "https://api2.watttime.org/v2/"
    }
}
```

#### username

The username you receive from WattTime.  This value is required when using a WattTime datasource.

#### password

The WattTime password for the username supplied.  This value is required when using a WattTime datasource.

#### baseUrl

The url to use when connecting to WattTime.  Defaults to [https://api2.watttime.org/v2/](https://api2.watttime.org/v2/).

In normal use, you shouldn't need to set this value, but this value can be used to enable integration testing scenarios or if the WattTime url should change in the future.

### Logging Configuration

This project is using standard [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging?tabs=command-line).  To configure different log levels, please see the documentation at this link.

### Sample Environment Variable Configuration Using WattTime

```bash
carbonAwareVars__carbonIntensityDataSource="WattTime"
carbonAwareVars__webApiRoutePrefix="/microsoft/cse/fsi"
carbonAwareVars__proxy__useProxy=true
carbonAwareVars__proxy__url="http://10.10.10.1"
carbonAwareVars__proxy__username="proxyUsername"
carbonAwareVars__proxy__password="proxyPassword"
wattTimeClient__username="wattTimeUsername"
wattTimeClient__password="wattTimePassword"
```

### Sample Json Configuration Using WattTime

```json
{
    "carbonAwareVars": {
        "carbonIntensityDataSource": "WattTime",
        "webApiRoutePrefix": "/microsoft/cse/fsi",
        "proxy": {
            "useProxy": true,
            "url": "http://10.10.10.1",
            "username": "proxyUsername",
            "password": "proxyPassword"
        }
    },
    "wattTimeClient":{
        "username": "wattTimeUsername",
        "password": "wattTimePassword",
    }
}
```
