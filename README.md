# Project Summary
An SDK to enable the creation of carbon aware applications, applications that do more when the electricity is clean and do less when the electricity is dirty.

## Appointments 
* Chair/Project lead - Vaughan Knight (MSFT)
* Vice Chair

## Projects Scope

For developers to build carbon aware software, there is a need for a unified baseline to be implemented.  The Carbon Aware Core SDK is a project to build a common core, that is flexible, agnostic, and open, allowing software and systems to build around carbon aware capabilities, and provide the information so those systems themselves become carbon aware.

The Carbon Aware Core API will look to standardise and simplify carbon awareness for developers through a unified API, command line interface, and modular carbon-aware-logic plugin architecture.
