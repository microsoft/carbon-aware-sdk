# Run Sample Console App

The sample app demonstrates how to use dependency injection to pull in the
packages and interact with the SDK.

The app is not intended to run as a standalone app. In order to build and run
the app, all the dependent packages need to be created first and then imported
in the app. Details on running the sample app can be found
[here](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk/blob/dev/docs/packaging.md/#Console)
